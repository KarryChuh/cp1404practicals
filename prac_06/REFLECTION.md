# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

During the learning process, I learned to watch course-related videos in advance before class.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I think it's not good that I always finish my homework on Sundays, which shows that I am not focused enough.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I will write down some difficult grammar in my notebook and review them frequently.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I should improve my coding skills and try to do more exercises in class.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

Honestly, this course is perfect; however, it would be easier for me to understand complex tasks if they were made simpler (like reviewing other people's code).
